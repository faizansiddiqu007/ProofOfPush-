## 1. Vision

A self-service, open-source verifier that **matches r√©sum√© statements with publicly verifiable GitHub activity**. We empower recruiters to skip the BS, and developers to showcase *evidence-backed* skill.

## 2. Problem Statement

* **R√©sum√© Inflation** ‚Äì Claims of ‚Äúproduction-grade systems‚Äù backed by tiny forks or tutorial repos.
* **Recruiter Time Sink** ‚Äì Manual code screens are slow and expensive.
* **Credible Devs Get Lost** ‚Äì Genuine talent often drowns in the noise.

## 3. MVP Feature Set

1. **R√©sum√© Parser** ‚Äì spaCy / OpenAI to pull skills & project claims.
2. **GitHub Analyzer** ‚Äì Aggregate language stats, commit volume, PR merges, issue activity.
3. **Claim Matcher** ‚Äì LLM + heuristics to assign confidence scores.
4. **Credibility Dashboard** ‚Äì Web UI + PDF export.
5. **Public API** ‚Äì `/verify` endpoint (rate-limited) for integrators.

## 5. Open Questions

1. How do we fairly weight private experience vs. public activity?
2. What‚Äôs the optimal scoring formula (heuristics vs. LLM weighting)?
3. Should we gate advanced features behind a token system or sponsorship?
